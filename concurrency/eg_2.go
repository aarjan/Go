/*
A sender can close a channel to indicate there are no more values to be sent.
reciever can test whether a channel has been close by assigning a second parameter to the receive expresssion:
as :
    v, ok := <-ch
ok is false if there are no more values to receive and the channel is closed.
The loop,
    for i := range c
    recieves values from the channel repeatedly until it is closed.



Note:
Only the sender should close a channel, never the receiver.
Sending on a closed channel will cause a panic.

Another note:
Channels aren't like files; you don't usually need to close them.
Closing is only necessary when the receiver must be told there are no more values coming,
such as to terminate a range loop.
